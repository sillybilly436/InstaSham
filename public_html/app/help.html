                <p>This is the help page! Here you can find out a little bit about 
                    InstaSham's features and how to use the platform.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Home: </strong>the home page is the first page of
                InstaSham that you will see after logging in with your username 
                and password. It will display the posts from only your friends, so 
                make sure to add friends!</p><br>
                <p><strong>User: </strong>the user page displays the profile picture, 
                username, and bio of a given user on InstaSham. If you are on your 
                personal page you can change the bio. This page will display posts 
                specifically from the user and have the ability to add new friends or
                view the current ones.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Create Post: </strong>this section is for the creation
                of new posts from the current user. There are features to add photos,
                add a caption, tag other users on the platform, and then press a 
                button to post. Once the post is created it will show up on the 
                user page.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Global: </strong>the global page is for exploring the 
                most recent posts from all of the users on InstaSham. It will display 
                the 20 most recent posts that were made so that you can be up to
                date on trends</p><br>
                <p><strong>Direct Messages: </strong>The direct messages allow a 
                user to send textual messages to another user on InstaSham. There 
                is a page that will display all of the existing messages with a search 
                bar at the top to find new people to chat with. There are buttons
                next to the existing messages so that you can open the chats on a 
                new window and continue the conversation.</p>
